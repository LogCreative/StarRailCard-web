## Usage

Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And run the script, pass the uid as the argument:
```bash
python main.py -u 109814396
```
If you want to change the language, for example, to Chinese (Simplified) with the correct font being used, then use:
```bash
python main.py -u 109814396 -l cn -f "NotoSansCJKsc-Bold"
```
where `NotoSansCJKsc-Bold` font should be installed on your computer manually.

You could get more help by
```bash
python main.py -h
```

After the generation, you could open `railcard.html` directly to preview the result. You could directly deploy those files to your website. Click the avatar to display the detail of different characters.
